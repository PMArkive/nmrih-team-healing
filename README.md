## Installation

- [Install Sourcemod](https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Installing_sourcemod) (1.11.0.6506 or higher is recommended for full functionality)
- Grab the latest zip from the [releases](https://github.com/dysphie/nmrih-team-healing/releases) section.
- Extract the contents into `addons/sourcemod`
- Refresh the plugin list (`sm plugins refresh` or `sm plugins load nmrih-team-healing` in server console)

## Usage

Equip a first aid kit or bandages and hold USE (Default: `E`) on another player to treat them. 
- Team healing is slightly faster than self healing by default. 
- Players can break out of healing by crouching. 
- There's an exponential cooldown on healing attempts to prevent griefing.
- (SM 1.11+ only) Healing is disabled when zombies are too close. Clients can toggle this protection off in their settings.


### Opting out

Players can opt out of healing via `sm_settings` -> `Medical Settings`

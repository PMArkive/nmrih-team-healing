## Installation

- [Install Sourcemod](https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Installing_sourcemod) (1.11.0.6506 or higher is recommended for full functionality)
- Grab the latest zip from the [releases](https://github.com/dysphie/nmrih-team-healing/releases) section.
- Extract the contents into `addons/sourcemod`
- Refresh the plugin list (`sm plugins refresh` or `sm plugins load nmrih-team-healing` in server console)

## Usage

Equip a first aid kit or bandages and hold USE (Default: `E`) on another player to treat them. 
- Team healing is slightly faster than self healing by default. 
- Players can break out of healing by crouching. 
- There's an exponential cooldown on healing attempts to prevent griefing.
- (SM 1.11+ only) Healing is disabled when zombies are too close. Clients can toggle this protection off in their settings.


### Opting out

Players can opt out of healing via `sm_settings` -> `Medical Settings`

## Global forwards

```cpp
/**
 * Called when a client attempts to heal a teammate
 *
 * @param healer		Client index of healer.
 * @param recipient		Client index of player getting healed.
 * @param item			Entity index of the medical item.
 * @param itemID		Medical ID of the medical item.
 * @param cooldown		If returning Plugin_Handled, whether a cooldown should be applied.
 * @return				Plugin_Handled to block the action, Plugin_Continue otherwise.
 */
forward Action OnClientBeginTeamHeal(int healer, int recipient, int item, MedicalID itemID, bool& cooldown);


/**
